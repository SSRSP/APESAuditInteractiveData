                    My Parents were generally receptive to the suggested solutions and even offered up some of their own. I think that we all agreed that we do really good on recycling already and that a lot of the trash observed during the audit was an impact of the fact that we did not have a functioning kitchen and dishwasher during the audtis and were using mostly paper plates and plastic bottles. My parents have been wanting me to take shorter showers for a while now so they were very receptive to the water suggestions. I'm not sure what lens it would fit in but my father says that our septic tank is getting too much water so i suppose that that would be economic mostly and slightly environmental reasons for us to lower our water usage. I think that they were slightly surprised by how much the sinks use and that they expected the shower to be the most. I think that they are very open to implementing these solutions and would perhaps even encourage it. As for electricity, I think that they are open to the idea of it but the social impacts of having to rememnber to turn off lights and monitors and also recognizing when they aren't in use could be a somewhat difficult task at times. For Transportation, my parents seemed very receptive to combinding trips and carpool and even offered their own solution of when I start driving in a year or two for me to get a car with good gas effieciency which I thought was a very good idea and added it to my solution cards. In general, I think that we're already doing decently well with our eco footprint but we can definetly improve and I think my parents are able and willing to make changes to improve.
